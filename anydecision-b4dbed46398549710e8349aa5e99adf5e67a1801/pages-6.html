<p>We all get overwhelmed with too many options. Any Decision is a tool that helps you sort through your list of options by taking it two items at a time so that you can make a decision. All you need to do is pick between the two displayed, and move on to the next. We'll sort out the rest. By the end, we'll provide your final decision and even a fancy table to show your ranked order of the remaining options.
Check out our <a href="#help-point";>Help Section</a> for detailed instructions.</p>
<p>If your group is having trouble making a decision, click on "Next Person" under the results section. Let each person go through the list of randomly paired items, and we'll compare the results at the end.</p>
<p>This process of grabbing a pair of items from a list and comparing them is called a "pairwise comparison." Before now, if someone wanted to make a pairwise comparison they had to do it on paper. We have decided to make this process as easy as possible by intelligently ranking items throughout the comparison process.</p>

<p><span class="bolded">Who are you?</span><br />
We're the answer to all your decision making problems. This website is dedicationed to making pairwise comparisons as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Also, we, as creators, are the brothers Micah and Zack Robinson. We care about user research and design, and we have touble making decisions. We wanted to make a simple tool that helps people pair down decisions in this information rich world of ours.</p>

<p><span class="bolded">How can you afford to do this?</span><br />
We spent most of our free time working on this project just for fun, but in order to keep up with the fees associated with owning a webpage, we could really use support in the shape of donations from users. If you can, we would really appreciate a <a href="#donate-point">donation of any size</a>.</p>

<p><span class="bolded">Can I give you feedback?</span><br />
Of course you can! Click that little button at the bottom of the screen that you probably minimized out of habit. Alternatively, you can send us an email: <a href="mailto:admin@anydecision.com">admin@anydecision.com</a>. We would love to hear from you!</p>
